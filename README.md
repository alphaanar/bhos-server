Server description: An exclusive guild for students, faculty, and staff of Baku Higher Oil School, designed to encompass all its activities. Engage in discussions, learn, discover events, stay updated on news, join clubs, and more! All within a dedicated space designed for the entire university community.

So here we go! To familiarize everyone with this new project, we have decided to write an article briefly explaining everything one needs to know to be roughly on the same page with us. Please be sure to carefully read till the end since it is very crucial for us that you understand and support this project along the way!

## Introduction

Since around October 2022, there has been one big idea stuck in my head about having a Discord server where a whole host of people can conveniently gather and talk to one another. Well, all my previous attempts did fail in the end, yet again, we have come up with something new and _of a larger scale_ this time. Before, I was trying to focus only on bringing my close friends together, which faced many issues, the biggest being inactivity. Now though, the idea is to group **everyone** associated with this university and offer them an easier way of doing - _anything_. That is right - as the baseline goal, we want to enable everything you would already do without the server, but now with more ease. We started to gradually implement various parts of the server during this summer as two Information Security students, **Anar Bastanov** (me) and **Nigar Abasli**. We, the only two administrators behind this _"innovation"_, know that we will also have to look for additional moderators as we cannot manage all this on our own, but more on that later. Let's quickly run through the notion in more detail.

## Discord Basics

First and foremost, because many of you have never even used Discord before, we can begin by discussing how this - relatively new - social media works.

Note: <ins>You may as well want to watch video tutorials or read other, more comprehensive articles. Experimenting on your own and trying different features might help further.</ins> _[Click here to see their official but two years old video.](https://youtu.be/TJ13BA3-NR4)_

### Servers

Think of a server as a container for **multiple** chats (similar to "a group of WhatsApp groups," but we call them "[servers](#servers)" and "[channels](#channels)" and they have a few variations), [roles](#roles), bots, events, expressions (such as emojis, stickers, and sound effects) and many more features that an unlimited number of users can _share_ once they become a member of the same server. There is a list of all the servers you joined on the left side of your screen. You must click on a particular server's icon to view its channels that are available to you and interact with that environment.

### Channels

A channel is a single chat among many others grouped in a server. There are many **types** of channels, but the two basic ones are:
1. Text channels: Where you can send messages and text people.
2. Voice channels: Where you can speak, stream your screen, turn on your camera, etc.

Some channels are accessible to everyone, whereas some can be viewed only by those with permission. Discord also has far too many advanced features in terms of "channels"; however, you will get to see them hopefully as you get more used to this platform.

### Roles

In many cases, servers have thousands of members, and there needs to be a way to categorize them. Roles can help with a few things:
1. Permit members to perform certain actions, such as changing a nickname, uploading files, or even banning someone from the server.
2. Grant access to private channels.
3. Customize the color of people's display names that have this role.

Yet these points are not everything to mention. Keep in mind that you can be assigned multiple roles at the same time, hence possibilities are endless!

### Friends

You can send a friend request to anyone, and once they accept it, voila, you are their friend! This allows you to "[DM](#direct-messages)" them, see their activity status, and so on unless they changed something in their privacy settings - _which you should go and take a close look at._ Unlike countless other platforms, where the term "follower" is more preferred, Discord does not have this "race for likes", "showing off", or "why did you not reply to my stories". ~~Discord is chill about it, and all you do is not simply post a few pictures of the moments in your life taken out of context to pretend to live a better life.~~

### Direct Messages

As you would expect, you can also enter an isolated chat for only two of you to discuss topics you want to keep to yourselves. _The public may not be ready yet to hear your bizarre plans about taking over the world._ You can open your DM list by clicking the topmost button above your server list on the left.
