Server description: An exclusive guild for students, faculty, and staff of Baku Higher Oil School, designed to encompass all its activities. Engage in discussions, learn, discover events, stay updated on news, join clubs, and more! All within a dedicated space designed for the entire university community.

So here we go! In order to familiarize everyone with this new project, we have decided to write an article briefly explaining everything one needs to know to be roughly on the same page with us. Please be sure to carefully read till the end as it is very crucial for us that you understand and support this project along the way!

## Introduction

Right since October 2022, there has been one big idea stuck with me about having a Discord server where a whole host of people can conveniently gather and talk to one another. Well, all my previous attempts did fail in the end, yet again, we have come up with something new and _of a larger scale_ this time. Before, I was trying to focus only on bringing my close friends together, which faced many issues, the biggest one being inactivity. Now though, the idea is to group **everyone** associated with this university and offer them an easier way of doing - _anything_. That is right - as the baseline goal, we want to enable everything that you would already do without the server, but just with more ease. We started to gradually realize and implement parts of the server during this summer as two Information Security students, **Anar Bastanov** (me) and **Nigar Abasli**. We, the only two administrators behind this _"innovation"_, know that we will have to also look for additional moderators since we cannot really manage all this on our own, but more on that later. Let's quickly run through the notion in more detail.

## Discord Basics

First off, due to the fact that many of you have never even used Discord before, we can begin by discussing how this (relatively new) social media works.
