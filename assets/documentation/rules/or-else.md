Our rules, except those enforced by clubs, have been carefully verified, and all of them must be adhered to by every member. In the event of noncompliance or violations, our moderators and administrators are authorized to take appropriate actions. Please keep in mind that you were required to have explicitly agreed to the rules before you could join this server.

Severity of a moderator's actions depends on a number of parameters. These include the gravity of the rule you broke, the rank of the individuals involved in the situation, how often you commit infractions, the subjectivity of the staff, and so forth.

We also provide the list of penalties in order to be more transparent about our policies, although we do not ensure the full list.
* Reminder of rules
* Content removal
* Content blocking
* User warnings
* User [time outs](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ>)
* Notification to departments
* Membership restriction
* Membership termination

As a sidenote, durations of penalties are undefined. For appeals, either visit <#1141987029392031805> or directly contact our staff through their DMs if you are unable to access the channel.
