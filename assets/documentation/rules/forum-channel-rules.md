A [forum](<https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation>) is a special type of channel in Discord that you can use to create posts. In our server, we intend to use forum channels primarily to provide or ask for help, hence these rules and guidelines written below focus on management and clarity of questions and answers.

* Follow the server's overall rules and guidelines, as they may also apply to forum channels. Refer to <#1146807512952225894>.
* Do not post a problem that you yourself showed little to no effort to solve, you would be wasting everyone's time, including yours.
* Select at least one tag related to your post, but you can select as many tags as you want if they are all related.
* Take a look at commonly made mistakes when asking questions. Refer to [dontasktoask](<https://dontasktoask.com>), [xyproblem](<https://xyproblem.info>), [nohello](<https://no-hello.com>), and others.
* Try to provide the description of your problem in as much detail as possible for others to understand you clearly.
* If you do have screenshots or any sources that help with clarity, please add them too.
* Include what failed solutions or attempts you have already tried, if any at all.
* Hide any sensitive or private information to prevent accidental leaks.
* Do your best at spelling and formatting in your texts properly, such as punctuations, paragraphing, markdowns (**bold**, _italic_, __underline__, etc.), code blocks, and so forth.
* Be patient and do not directly ping anybody or any role for help, even if it has been quiet for a while and no one seems to answer you.
* Close your post once your issue is resolved.
* Refrain from spamming with posts, especially if they are trivial.
* After someone eventually responded to you, kindly update them on the current state of the issue, e.g. whether the solution worked.
* Only provide constructive criticisms, do not spoon-feed or mislead users, and follow academic honesty.
