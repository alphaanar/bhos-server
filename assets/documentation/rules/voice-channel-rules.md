We do encourage you to participate in various voice channel discussions and activities; however, to avoid unnecessary drama and hatred, it must be regulated as well. Please try your best to follow the etiquette guidelines expected in this server.

* Follow the server's overall rules and guidelines, as they may also apply to voice channels. Refer to <#1146807512952225894>.
* Ensure your microphone is set up properly to minimize background noise, loud or disruptive sounds, and echo. Use Discord's push-to-talk (PTT) feature if it is necessary.
* When participating in voice chats, use headphones to prevent audio feedback and echo.
* Take turns when conversing and listen actively in order not to talk over others. 
* Keep conversations relevant to the voice channel's designated topic or purpose, if any. You may also want to consider moving to another channel in case two conversations happen to overlap.
* Ensure that the content discussed or shared in voice channels is age-appropriate and adheres to Discord's Terms of Service (ToS).
* Do not impersonate other users, including using their voices or identities.
* Use the special text chat of the voice channel you are in instead whenever you need to send a text.
* Avoid spamming voice channels with repeated messages or the excessive use of emojis, sounds, or effects.
* Do not abuse bots to disrupt or spam voice channels and adhere to the general bot usage guidelines.
* Respect everyone's privacy, and do not record or share voice conversations without the explicit consent of all participants.
* Avoid excessive switching between voice channels without a valid reason.
* Mute yourself when you are going Away From Keyboard (AFK) or more preferably switch to <#1141298236791996458>.
* Follow the instructions of server moderators and administrators as they are responsible for maintaining a safe and enjoyable environment.
